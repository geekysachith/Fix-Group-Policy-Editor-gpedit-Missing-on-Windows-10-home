HOW TO ENABLE GROUP POLICY EDITOR IN WINDOWS 10 HOME
While Microsoft retained the Group Policy Editor feature for Windows Pro and Enterprise edition, you can get it on Windows Home too. Before you proceed, take a backup of everything on your computer. Make sure that your Windows is in sync with one of the cloud storage services. You don’t want to redo all the settings from scratch.

Earlier this year, a Reddit user posted a script that seems to be working for some Windows users. It’s a hit or miss case but you may try. I've had success with my computer.

Copy the code into a notepad file and name it windows-home-gpedit-hack.bat and choose All Files in Save as type field. Don’t save it as a .txt file but a .bat file instead. That is important so make sure you have disabled the 'Hide extensions for the known file types' from the Folder options under the View tab at the top.

After that, right-click on the .bat file to select Run as administrator and give necessary permissions when asked in the pop-up that follows.

It is also possible that the script will only add the GUI, but you won’t be able to make any changes in the policies. As I said, it’s a hit or miss but worth a try.
